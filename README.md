- **Donation Processing**: A secure system for handling and recording donations.
- **Database Management**: Stores fundraiser data, user profiles, and transaction history.
- **API Integration**: Supplies the frontend with endpoints to create a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core language for backend development.
- **Flask/Django** – Framework for handling server-side logic and building APIs.
- **MySQL** – Database for securely managing and storing data.
- **JWT** – JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.

This backend is structured to integrate smoothly with the frontend, enabling dynamic and secure interactions across the platform.
